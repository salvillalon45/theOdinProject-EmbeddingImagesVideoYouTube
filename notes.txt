I ran into this error everytime I tried to run the command npx tailwindcss init
To fix it I did the following:
- Install the latest version of node. I was using v14.15.4, but now I have v16.13.1
- Doing this also updated npm and npx which are now 8.1.2
- Then I tried npx tailwindcss init, but I still got an error
- I then tried this command `npx tailwindcss-cli@latest init --postcss`. I see that also `npx tailwindcss-cli@latest init` this command works as well
- And I got it working!
- I then created this script to help build the stylesheet `"build-css": "npx tailwindcss-cli@latest -i ./assets/stylesheets/tailwind.css -o ./public/assets/stylesheets/tailwind.css"`
- I included npx since `yarn` nor `npm run` was not working
